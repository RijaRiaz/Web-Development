        <h1 id="heading">ID and Classes</h1>
        <p class="para">we can assign one ID to one tag only. While we can assign 
            one class name to multiple tags.

            <h1> Div and Span</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="div2">
            <p>We use div as block element.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div3">
            <p>We use span for <span class="span1">inline elements</span> for example to style a specific word inside a div.</p>
        </div>
        <h1> Floating</h1>
        <p>Elements can float horizontally and not vertically.
            For this we use properties, float: left; and clear: both;
        </p>
        <div class="div4">
            <h1>Fixed Positioning</h1>
            <p>Fixed on the screen and does not move when you scroll the window.</p>

            <h1>Absolute Positioning</h1>
            <p>Change the position relative to the original page. We can place element anywhere on the page with it. 
                Depend on parent.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Display</h1>
            <p>If we set visibility to hidden, the block will hide but space occupy by it will remain oppocupied as empty. If we use
                Display: none; the space will not be occupied and the block will remove.</p>
